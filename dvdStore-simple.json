Julie Taymor’s biopic takes us behind the canvas to reveal the artist, the activist, the revolutionary. And knowing what we do now about lead actress Selma Hayek’s off-screen experience, this film proves an even greater victory.",

But that’s not the case with Mira Nair’s feel-good drama about a Uganda girl’s path to chess champ, adapted from an ESPN sports essay.

But it’s so much more than that—it’s Ergüven’s personal comment on what it means to be a woman in Turkey.",
